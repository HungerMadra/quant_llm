# Stock Price Prediction Using LLMs

## Overview
This project aims to build a system that predicts stock price movements and optimizes trading strategies using large language models (LLMs). The project progresses through multiple phases, starting with data acquisition and preprocessing, building baseline models, and advancing to LLM training, backtesting, and profitability testing. The ultimate goal is to create a trading pipeline capable of generating profitable trading strategies.

## Project Phases

### **Phase 1: Data Acquisition and Preparation**
1. **Objective**: Gather and clean historical stock trading data.
2. **Steps**:
   - Collect minute-level stock data using APIs like Yahoo Finance or Alpha Vantage.
   - Clean data by removing missing values and outliers.
   - Add features such as moving averages, percentage changes, and volume trends.
   - Create a labeled dataset with a `Target` column (price up/down).
3. **Milestone**: Preprocessed dataset ready for training.

### **Phase 2: Simple Model Development**
1. **Objective**: Build baseline models to predict price movements.
2. **Steps**:
   - Train Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forests.
   - Evaluate models using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
3. **Milestone**: A simple, working model for price predictions.

### **Phase 3: Backtesting and Strategy Simulation**
1. **Objective**: Simulate trading strategies based on model predictions.
2. **Steps**:
   - Use backtesting libraries like Backtrader to evaluate trading strategies.
   - Incorporate transaction costs, slippage, and realistic trading constraints.
3. **Milestone**: A backtesting framework to evaluate profitability.

### **Phase 4: Advanced Modeling with LLMs**
1. **Objective**: Train LLMs to classify stock price movements.
2. **Steps**:
   - Fine-tune pretrained LLMs like GPT-2 or DistilBERT for numeric data.
   - Design custom loss functions that reward profitability over accuracy.
3. **Milestone**: A fine-tuned LLM capable of predicting stock price movements.

### **Phase 5: Profitability Testing**
1. **Objective**: Test the LLMâ€™s performance in simulated trading scenarios.
2. **Steps**:
   - Use backtesting to measure ROI, Sharpe ratio, and hit rate.
   - Optimize hyperparameters and strategies to maximize profitability.
3. **Milestone**: A validated trading strategy demonstrating profitability.

### **Phase 6: Deployment and Future Exploration**
1. **Objective**: Deploy the system and explore enhancements.
2. **Steps**:
   - Implement paper trading or real-time simulations with live market data.
   - Experiment with additional data sources, such as news sentiment or macroeconomic indicators.
   - Explore reinforcement learning to further optimize trading strategies.
3. **Milestone**: A deployable trading pipeline.

## Usage
1. **Preprocess Data**:
   - Modify `config.py` to specify stock tickers and data sources.
   - Run `preprocess_data.py` to prepare training datasets.

2. **Train Models**:
   - Use `train_baseline_model.py` to train simple models.
   - Use `train_llm.py` to fine-tune the LLM.

3. **Backtesting**:
   - Run `backtest_strategy.py` to simulate trades.

## Key Challenges
- Adapting LLMs for time-series prediction.
- Handling the noisy, non-stationary nature of financial data.
- Designing a reward mechanism that aligns with profitability.

---

## Future Work
- Integrate additional data sources like sentiment analysis.
- Implement reinforcement learning for strategy optimization.
- Deploy the model for real-time trading scenarios.
